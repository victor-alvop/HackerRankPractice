## Task

The provided code stub reads an integer, `n`, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers `i < n`, print `iÂ²`.

### Example

The list of non-negative integers that are less than `n` is:  
`0, 1, 2` (if `n = 3`)  
Print the square of each number on a separate line:

0
1
4


---

### Input Format

The first and only line contains the integer `n`.

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 20`

---

### Output Format

Print `n` lines, one corresponding to the square of each non-negative integer less than `n`.
