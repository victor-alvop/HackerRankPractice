## Problem: Hash of a Tuple

### Description
Given an integer **`n`** and a list of **`n`** space-separated integers, your task is to:

1. Create a **tuple** of those `n` integers.
2. Compute the **hash value** of the tuple using Python's built-in `hash()` function.
3. Print the resulting hash value.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: `hash()` is a built-in function in Python and does not need to be imported. While the result of `hash()` may vary between runs in local environments, it is consistent in platforms like HackerRank.

### Input Format

- The first line contains an integer **`n`** â€” the number of elements in the tuple.
- The second line contains **`n`** space-separated integers.

---

### Output Format

- Print a single integer: the **hash value** of the created tuple.
